# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction
predicting the price range for mobile based on its features.
Mobile now a days is one of the most selling and purchasing device. Every day new mobiles with new version and more features are launched. In this competitive mobile phone market, companies want to understand the sales data of the mobile phones and factors that drive the prices.

The objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone (eg :- RAM, Internal Memory etc) and its selling price.
Further, based on different features of the mobile phones, develop a model that would classify each mobile into different categories of price range i.e. into categorical values of 0(low), 1(moderate), 2(high), and 3(very high).
